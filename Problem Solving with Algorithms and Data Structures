Big O
    number of operations less important
    than dominant operation
    as n gets larger

    Order of magnitude function
    describes the part of the function
    that increases the fastest
    as value of n increases.

    Example
    Number of steps in function T =
        T(n) = 5n^2 + 27n + 1005.
    When n = 1,
        constant 1005
        coefficient 27
    seem to be dominant.
    However, when n is large, they
    become less important.
